# Skincare Shop Management System

<p>ðŸ”¹ Developed for IT0011 Final Project ðŸ”¹</p>

### Objectives: 
The program will provide a user-friendly interface for managing and purchasing skincare products. It will have two main user roles:

1. Customers:

- Browse available skincare products with details (e.g., name, price, description, quantity).

- Place orders by selecting products and providing their name.

- Receive a printed receipt of their order.

2. Admins:

- Perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on products.

- View and manage customer orders.

- Generate a summary report displaying total orders, sales, and other relevant statistics.

The system will feature a well-structured GUI with a grid layout for ease of navigation and usability. JSON file handling will be used for data persistence to store product details, customer orders, and reports.
